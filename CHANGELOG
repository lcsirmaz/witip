    version 2.2
    adding reverse Ingleton notation, description, copyright info

Dec 7, 2018
    version info
    now 0=0 and 0>=0 are valid results.
    on the main page a checkbox can be used to choose if checking with
      constraints rather than using two submit buttons.
    constraints pages allow checking/unchecking constraints without
      clicking on the button. 
    all pages allow deleting lines without blocking the navigation
      buttons.
    improved help text on the wITIP page
    improved error messages on the session page
    modified some printing options

    bugfix: in perl_lib/wMainPage.pm the result of the splice call was
    used, thus returning some old lines only
Aug 13, 2018
   when the input line ends with a newline character, the error message
   "extra characters at the end" is not informative. Added explanation
   for invisible characters in perl_lib/wParser.pm

   bugfix: H(a|b) was defined wrongly in template/wDefault.pm
Dec 5, 2017
   some main changes and bugfixes.
   - new batch processing: macros and constraints now can be loaded from
     a file. Saving a command file recreating the present set of macros
     and constraints. Done in the new module wList.pm
   - binary saving is renamed to export / import
   - new constraint type "common information" is added; it stipulates that
     the first acts as a common information of the next two.
   - improving help and explanation, eliminating the "unroll" word
   - improving/adding hover texts (title attributes) for several items
   - adding <IfModule mod_perl.c> to the Apache config file
   bugfixes:
   - cannot change the allocted LP time on the config page - corrected
   - when creating printable content, constraints were not html-escaped
     (causing messed up output when the constrain contained < or > ) -
     corrected
   warning: the libglpk v36.2 package reports timeout as failure. Compile
     glpk from source to avoid this bug.
