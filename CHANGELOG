   some main changes and bugfixes.
   - new batch processing: macros and constraints now can be loaded from
     a file. Saving a command file recreating the present set of macros
     and constraints. Done in the new module wList.pm
   - binary saving is renamed to export / import
   - new constraint type "common information" is added; it stipulates that
     the first acts as a common information of the next two.
   - improving help and explanation, eliminating the "unroll" word
   - improving/adding hover texts (title attributes) for several items
   - adding <IfModule mod_perl.c> to the Apache config file
   bugfixes:
   - cannot change the allocted LP time on the config page - corrected
   - when creating printable content, constraints were not html-escaped
     (causing messed up output when the constrain contained < or > ) -
     corrected
   warning: the libglpk v36.2 package reports timeout as failure. Compile
     glpk from source to avoid this bug.
