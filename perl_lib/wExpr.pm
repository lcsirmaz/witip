=head2 Data structure

=over 2

=item Result

The return value is a hash with the following fields:

    res     => number, indicating the result type (see below)
    label   => integer, request number when result >= 3
    err     => the error text
    pos     => the position where the error was found
    aux     => auxiliary error text

The res field is one of the following:

    1 => syntax error, fields err, pos, aux are filled
    2 => unroll, the unrolled text is in aux
    3 => result is pending, label is the request number (unique within SSID)
    4 => request LP timeout
    5 => request failed (some LP problem)
    6 => the relation is TRUE
    7 => the relation is FALSE
    8 => only >= is true
    9 => only <= is true
   10 => simplifies to 0 = 0
   11 => simplifies to 0 >= 0

=item History

Requests (with results) are stored in the expression history file.  Each
history item takes a line organized as follows:

I<type>,I<label>,I<standalone>,I<text>

Here I<type> is a digit as in the "res" field above except for 1 which cannot
occur. I<label> is an integer identifying the request uniquely; I<standalone>
is 0 or 1 showing whether the request was evaluated without (0) or with (1)
constraints.  Finally, I<text> is the request; unrolled form added after
'+++' for type 2.  When a pending request is completed, additional line is
added to the history file where I<standalone> is 2.  The history stores the
content of the editing field with I<type> equal to 99.

=item Pending requests

Syntactically correct requests are passed to the wMakeLP::parse_relation()
which generates an LP instance and the LP solver is launched.  After setting
up the problem the solver returns, leaving behind a background process. 
That background process writes the answer (solution) to a result file.  Each
request is assigned a unique label (integer) which is returned, and can be
used to enquire about pending jobs.

=head2 Procedures

=over 2

=item $result = wExpr::check_expr($session,$string,$standalone)

Parse the $string as a query.  When $standalone is set, the relation is to
be checked without constraints (the id table is not loaded).  Returns a hash
as explained above.  The res field shows the result, other fields are filled
only when contain relevant information.

When successful, the query string $string with the result code is added to the
history.

=item ($code,$history) = wExpr::check_result($session,$label)

Check if the job identified by $label has finished.  If yes, remove (unlink)
both the problem and the result files.  The returned code is the one as
indicated in the return structure.  $history is the string to be put into
the expression history file, or empty if the job did not finish yet.

In some cases calls to check_result() may overlap resulting in loss of
information about some jobs.  If for a pending request the LP problem file
is not found, then we assume that this is the case, and return a failure
indication, even if the history file contains the right answer.
