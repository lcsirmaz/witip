# ABOUT
    render_block($session,"about","About wITIP",<<BLOCK);
wITIP is a web-based <b>I</b>nformation <b>T</b>heoretic <b>I</b>nequality 
<b>P</b>rover.
Linear entropy inequalities can be checked for validity, that is,
whether the inequality is a consequence of the basic Shannon 
inequalities and the specified constraints.
<br>
wITIP uses extended syntax for expressions, a user-friendly 
syntax checker, macros, and &quot;unrolling&quot;,
where complex entropy expressions are unrolled into a linear combination
of simple entropies.
<br>
<b>L%check%Checking%</b> &ndash; to check an L%expr%entropy expression% for L%method%validity%, enter it to the box
at the bottom of the &quot;check&quot; page:

<div class="indent">
  <!--<span class="resfalse">false</span>--> S%+1.234*H(X|Y)-12.234*I(A;B|H) <= -2H(B,X,Y)#+1.234*(x|y)-12.234*(a,b|h) <= -2bxy%
</div>
<b>L%constr%Constraints%</b> &ndash;
can be added and queries are checked assuming all constraints are true. 
The constraint below stipulates that the variable sets form a Markov chain:
<div class="indent">
  S%Alpha,Beta -> Beta,Gamma -> Gamma,Delta -> Tau# ab -> bc -> cx -> y%
</div>
<b>L%macros%Macros%</b> &ndash;
are shorthands for (linear) entropy expressions; the macro
below defines the conditional L%ingleton%Ingleton% expression:
<div class="indent">
  S%D(A;B;X;Y|E) = -I(A;B|E)+I(A;B|X,E)+I(A;B|Y,E)+I(X,Y|E)#D(a,b,x,y|e)=-(a,b|e)+(a,b|xe)+(a,b|ye)+(x,y|e)%
</div>
After it has been defined, the macro can be used in any expression.
<br>
<b>L%unroll%Unrolling%</b> &ndash;
computes the difference of two L%expr%entropy expressions% as a linear 
combination of entropies:
<div class="indent">
S%D(A1,X;A2,Y;C;D|Z1,Z2) =? [A1,X,Z1,Z2;A2,Y,Z1,Z2;C,Z1;D,Z1]#D(ax,by,c,d|vw) =? [axvw,byvw,cv,dv]%
<br>
S%H(C,D,Z1)-H(C,D,Z1,Z2)#cdv-cdvw%
</div>
<p></p>

L%history%history%, and the  L%copyright%copyright% information.
<p></p>
BLOCK
########################################################################
# STYLE
    render_block($session,"style","Syntax style",<<SYNTAX_STYLE);

Entropy L%expr%expressions% can be entered using two different styles:
<i>traditional</i> or <i>simplified</i>.  The traditional style follows the
style of the L%history%original% ITIP software:
random variables are identifiers, such as S%Winter% or
S%var_002%; variables in a list are separated by commas, and basic
information measures are entered in textbook style:
<div class="indent">
  S%I(Winter,Spring; Fall | var_01)%
</div>
which denotes the conditional joint information of S%Winter,Spring% and 
S%Fall% conditioned on S%var_01%.
<br>
The <i>simplified</i> style simplifies and speeds up entering queries.
Random variables are restricted to lower case letters only (but see the
L%var%description%); variables are simply put next
to each other to denote their joint distribution; and basic information
measures are recognized without the letters S%H% or S%I%.  Thus 
S%(ax,by)#(ax,by)%
is the joint information of the random variable pairs S%a,x% and S%b,y%.

<br>

The following two examples query the validity of identical entropy
expressions; the first one is entered in traditional style, the second one
using simplified style. The first term is the L%ingleton%Ingleton expression%.

<div class="indent">
<!-- <span class="restrue">true</span> --> S%[A;B;X;Y]+I(Z;B|X)+I(Z;X|B)+I(B;X|Z) >= -3*I(Z;A,Y|B,X)%<br>
<!-- <span class="restrue">true</span> --> S%[a,b,c,d]+(e,b|c)+(e,c|b)+(b,c|e) >= -3*(e,ad|bc)%
</div>

The style can be chosen and fine-tuned in the L%configure%wITIP configuration%.
See the description of L%var%random variables% and L%sequences%variable
sequences% for more information.

<p></p>

<b>The examples are shown in the chosen style with the chosen list-separating character.</b>
To see how the examples look like using different style
parameters, please L%configure%change the style%.

<p></p>
SYNTAX_STYLE
#####################################################################
# VARIABLES
    render_block($session,"var","Random variables",<<RANDOM_VARS);
Random variables and variable sequences can be entered using two
different L%style%style%: <i>traditional</i>, or <i>simplified</i>.
<br>
In <i>traditional</i> style arbitrary identifiers (consisting of letters,
digits and underscore) can denote random variables, such as S%Winter% or
S%var_002%. This notation is similar to the one used in textbooks
where random variables are typically denoted by a single capital letter
optionally followed by an index or a prime: S%A%, S%X_32% or S%X'%.
<br>
The <i>simplified</i> style restricts how random variables can be
written &ndash; typically to a single lower case letter, which
allows entering complex entropy expressions in a more succinct way.
Depending on the L%configure%configuration%, variable names in the simple style
might also end with a single digit, or a sequence of digits.
<p></p>
In both styles wITIP allows primes appended to variable names such as
S%a'% or S%a''%.
<p></p>
RANDOM_VARS
#####################################################################
# SEQUENCES
    render_block($session,"sequences","Sequence of random variables",<<SEQUENCE);
The joint distribution of several random variables is denoted by
listing all individual variables next to each other. In 
<i>traditional</i> style the variables are separated by commas as in
S%Spring,Summer, Winter, Fall% (spaces are optional). In <i>simplified</i>
style simply write the variables next to each other either with or 
without spaces; that is, both S%a b c% and S%abc% denote the joint distribution of
the three variables S%a%, S%b%, and S%c%.
<p></p>
SEQUENCE
#####################################################################
# ENTROPY
    render_block($session,"entropy","Entropy terms",<<ENTROPY);
The entropy of (the joint distribution of) a variable list is 
written the usual way:
<div class="indent">S%H(Spring,Summer,Fall)#H(abx)%,</div>
where the letter S%H% is followed by a L%sequences%variable sequence%
enclosed in parentheses.
<br>
Other standard information measures can be written similarly:
<ul><li>S%H(Spring;Winter | Summer)#H(ab|x)% &ndash; conditional entropy,</li>
<li>S%I(A,B;X)#I(ab,x)% &ndash; mutual information,</li>
<li>S%I(A,B;C|X,Y)#I(ab,c|xy)% &ndash; conditional mutual information.</li>
</ul>
In <i>simplified</i> style these information measures can be further
simplified. A variable sequence stands for its own entropy; conditional
entropy and mutual information can be written without the leading letters
S%H% and S%I%.
<ul><li>S%ab% &ndash; the entropy of the variable pair S%a% and S%b%,</li>
<li>S%(ab|cd)% &ndash; conditional entropy &ndash; in tranditional style 
this should be written as S%H(a,b|c,d)%.
<li>S%(ab,cd)#(ab,cd)% mutual information, same as S%I(ab,cd)#I(ab,cd)%,</li>
<li>S%(ab,cd|xy)#(ab,cd|xy)% conditional mutual information, same as
S%I(ab,cd|xy)#I(ab,cd|xy)%.
</ul>
<p></p>
ENTROPY
#####################################################################
# INGLETON
    render_block($session,"ingleton","Ingleton expression",<<INGLETON);
The <i>Ingleton expression</i> plays an important role in Information
Theory. wITIP uses a special syntax for this expression:
<div class="indent">
S%[A;B;X;Y]#[a,b,x,y]% is an abbreviation for the Ingleton expression<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; S%-I(A;B)+I(A;B|X)+I(A;B|Y)+I(X;Y)#-I(a,b)+I(a,b|x)+I(a,b|y)+I(x,y)%.
</div>
There must be four L%sequences%variable sequences% inside the square
brackets.
<p></p>
INGLETON
#####################################################################
# EXPRESSIONS
    render_block($session,"expr","Entropy expression",<<EXPRESSION);
An <i>entropy expression</i> is a linear combination of 
L%entropy%entropy terms%, L%ingleton%Ingleton expression%,
and L%macros%macro invocations%. An example is
<div class="indent">
S%-1.234*H(X|Y) - 12.345I(A;B|H) + 3X(X;B|A,Y)#-1.234*(x|y) - 12.345(a,b|h) + 3X(x,b|ay)%
</div>
where S%X(;|)#X(,|)% is a L%macros%macro%. The S%*% sign between the
constant and the following term is optional and can be omitted.
<br>
When L%configure%allowed%, entropy expressions can be grouped by parentheses S%()%
(not recommended) or by braces S%{}%; and the whole group can be multiplied by 
some constant:
<div class="indent">
S%-3*{H(A)+H(B)-2{H(A|B)-H(B|A)}}#-3*{a+b-2{(a|b)-(b|a)}}%
</div>
Using parentheses for grouping may lead to unintended but 
syntactically correct expressions.
<p></p>
EXPRESSION
#####################################################################
# MACROS
    render_block($session,"macros","Macros",<<MACROS);
Next to L%entropy%entropy terms% and the L%ingleton%Ingleton expression%, 
an L%expr%expression% can also contain <i>macro invocations</i>.
Actually, a macro is a shorthand for a linear combination of other
L%expr%entropy terms%. Macros can be defined under the &quot;macros&quot; tab.
The macro definition starts with a capital letter from S%A% to S%Z% followed by the
argument list enclosed in parenteses. Arguments are separated by 
either S%;#,% or S%|% (the list separator character or the <i>pipe</i> symbol).
The same macro name can
identify several different macros depending on the number of arguments and
the argument separators. The following lines define two different macros with
four arguments each:
<div class="indent">
S%T(X;Y|Z1;Z2) = 3I(Z1,X;Y|Z2)+2I(X;Y,Z2|Z1)+H(X,Y|Z1,Z2)#T(x,y|t,z) = 3(tx,y|z)+2(x,ty|z)+(t,z|xy)%
<br>
S%T(a|b|c;d) = -H(a|b,c)+2I(a;c|b,d)-7*[a;b;c;d]#T(a|b|c,d) = -(a|bc)+2(a,c|bd)-7*[a,b,c,d]%
</div>
Only variables in the argument list can be used on the right-hand side. Macros
appearing in macro definitions are expanded immediately so must be defined earlier.
When invoking a
macro, each argument can be a L%var%variable% or a L%sequences%variable list%,
and the separators much match those in the definition. Thus
<div class="indent">
S%3*T(A,C;A,D|B,C;B,D) - 4T(X1,Z2|X2,Z2|Y1;Y2,Z2)#3*T(ac,ad|bc,bd) - 4T(xu|yu|t,u)%
</div>
expands the first and second definition, respectively.
<br>
Internally, macros are stored
in &quot;unrolled&quot; form using only entropies; this form is displayed when
clicking on a macro in the listing.
<br>To delete a macro, click on the trash bin icon next to the macro. 
After a trash bin icon has been selected no other action is possible (apart from
selecting / deselecting other macros) until one of the buttons
above the macros (delete, delete all, or cancel) is clicked.

<p></p>
MACROS
#####################################################################
# CONSTRAINTS
    render_block($session,"constr","Constraints",<<CONSTR);
Checking the L%method%validity% of an entropy query is done
relative to a set of selected <i>constraints</i>. Constraints can be added,
deleted, enabled or disabled under the &quot;constraints&quot; tab.
To add a constraint simply enter it into the input line at the bottom, and
click on the &quot;add constraint&quot; button. A constraint can be
<ul><li>a relation, that is two L%expr%entropy expressions% compared
by one of S%=%, S%<=% or S%>=%. Example:
<div class="indent">
  S%H(A,B,X) = H(A,B)+H(X)#abx = ab+x%
</div></li>
<li>a functional dependency: the first L%sequences%sequence% is
determined by the second one. There should be exactly two lists in
this constraint Example:
<div class="indent">
    S%A : X,Y#a : xy%
</div></li>
<li>an independence: the sequences are totally independent. There
must be at least two sequences.
<div class="indent">
   S%A . B1,B2 . X,Y . &middot;&middot;&middot;#a . bc . xy . &middot;&middot;&middot;% <br>
   or<br>
   S%A || B1,B2 || X,Y || &middot;&middot;&middot;#a || bc || xy || &middot;&middot;&middot;%
</div></li>
<li>a Markov chain: the lists form a Markov chain. There must be at least
three terms here, and they should not form a trivial Markov chain.
<div class="indent">
  S%A / B1,B2 / X,Y / &middot;&middot;&middot;#a / bc / uv / &middot;&middot;&middot;% <br>
  or<br>
  S%A -> B1,B2 -> X,Y -> &middot;&middot;&middot;#a -> bc -> uv -> &middot;&middot;&middot;%
</div></li>
</ul>
Constraints that are enabled have their checkbox ticked. Use the checkboxes to
enable or disable constraints.

<br>

To delete any or all constraints, click on the trash bin icon next to them. 
When changing which constraints are enabled, or when deleting them, no further
action is possible until one of the buttons above the
constraints is clicked.

<p></p>
CONSTR
#####################################################################
# CHECKING
    render_block($session,"check","Checking queries",<<CHECKING);
Enter your query into the bottom box of the &quot;check&quot; tab. A 
<i>query</i> is just two L%expr%entropy expressions% connected by
S%=% (equality), S%>=% (greater than or equal to), or S%<=% 
(less than or equal to) such as
<div class="indent">
S%[A;B;C;D]+I(A;B|Z)+I(B;Z|A)+I(Z;A|B) >= -3*I(C,D;Z|A,B)#[a,b,c,d]+(a,b|z)+(b,z|a)+(z,a|b) >= -3*(cd,z|ab)%
</div>
If the query is parsed succesfully, it is added to the list above the
query box, and passed to the L%method%LP solver% for checking.  Depending on
the response time of the LP solver, either the result is shown immediately,
or it appears later, when the solver finishes its work.  The result of the
query can be
<div class="textindent">
<table class="sample"><tbody>
<tr><th><span class="restrue">true</span></th><td>
   the query is a consequence of the non-negativity of the basic Shannon
   information measures (and the  L%constr%constraints% if checked with
   constraints).</td></tr>
<tr><th><span class="resfalse">false</span></th><td>
   the query is <b>not</b> a consequence of the above collection.</td></tr>
<tr><th><span class="resonly">only &ge;</span></th><td>
   the query asked for equality, but only &ge; holds (would get
   <span class="restrue">true</span> when asked for S%>=%, and 
   <span class="resfalse">false</span> when asked for S%<=%).</td></tr>
<tr><th><span class="resonly">only &le;</span></th><td>
   the query asked for equality, but only &le; holds (would get
   <span class="resfalse">false</span> when asked for S%>=%, and 
   <span class="restrue">true</span> when asked for S%<=%).</td></tr>
<tr><th><span class="resother">timeout</span></th><td>
   the LP solver failed to solve the problem in the allocated time.</td></tr>
<tr><th><span class="resother">failed</span></th><td>
   the LP solver failed, probably the problem is too large, or 
   numerically unstable.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

By default the query is checked relative to the enabled
L%constr%constraints%, in which case the query is marked with <span
class="constraint">C</span>.
This means that these constraints are assumed to
hold, and can be used along the basic Shannon inequalities in the derivation
of the query.  This mark does not mean that some (or all) 
of the constraints are actually necessary to derive the result, only 
that the checking was performed with constraints.

<p></p>
CHECKING
#####################################################################
# CHECKING
    render_block($session,"unroll","Unrolling",<<UNROLL);
Unrolling computes the difference of two L%expr%entropy expressions% as
a linear combination of entropies. The two sides are connected by S%=?%,
and the result is printed below the query as in the following example:
<div class="indent">
  S%[A;B;C;D] =? I(A;B|C)+I(A;B|D)+I(A;B)#[a,b,c,d] =? (a,b|c)+(a,b|d)+(c,d)%
  <br>
  S%-H(A)-H(B)+H(A,B)#-a-b+ab%
</div>
When the two sides are equal, the result is S%0%. The mnemonic can be:
what are the missing terms on the right hand side which make the two
expressions equal?
<br>
As unrolling does not involve any further computation, the result is
printed immediately.
<p></p>
UNROLL
#####################################################################
# CONFIGURE
    render_block($session,"configure","Configuring wITIP",<<CONFIGURE);
You can configure many features of wITIP under the &quot;config&quot; tab.
<p></p>
<strong>Appearence</strong><br>
Set the font family and the font size for macros, constraints, and
queries. This choice does not affect the font used in printing.
<br>
&quot;Table height&quot; sets the maximum height of the macro,
constraint and query tables. 
<p></p>
<strong>Macro definition</strong><br>
By default, all macro arguments must be used in the final (unrolled)
macro text. Uncheck this option if you want to use macro definitions
like this one, in which the first argument S%U#u% cancels out:
<div class="indent">
S%A(U,V,W)=I(U;V|W)+H(V|U,W)#A(u,v,w)=(u,v|w)+(v|uw)%
</div>
<strong>Syntax</strong><br>
Determine how wITIP processes the entered text; whether to use traditional
or simplified L%style%syle%; can parentheses S%()% or braces S%{}% be used to 
enclose subexpressions; and finally whether variables can or cannot
end in a sequence of primes.
<p></p>
<strong>Simple style variables and list separator</strong><br>
By default, simple style allows only single lower case letters (optionally
followed by primes if configured) as variable names. You can
extend the recognized variable names (before the primes) by allowing one
or more of the following possibilities:
<ul><li>a (lower case) letter and single digit: S%a1%</li>
<li>a letter followed by any digit sequence: S%a123%</lI>
<li>a letter, an underscore and a digit: S%a_2%</li>
<li>a letter, an underscore, and a digit sequence: S%a_4321%</li>
</ul>
By default, none of those possibilities are enabled as it would be
easier to enter unintended but syntactically correct queries.
<br>
The simple style list separator character can be chosen from a
short list of possibilities. Use the one which fits your
taste.
<p></p>
<strong>LP response time</strong><br>
Each L%check%query% is passed to the L%method%LP solver% which answers
the question. The default time limit is 5 seconds. You can 
set this limit higher (up to 10 minutes), or lower (down to 1 second).
Typically the more random variables are used in the query, the longer
the LP solver needs to work. The increase is very steep as the problem size
grows exponentially. Up to six or seven variables the result is almost
immediate; over thirteen variables due to
numerical instability the LP solver might fail to solve
the problem or could return a wrong solution.
<br>
The query is marked with <span class="resother">timeout</span> if the 
time limit was exceeded. In this case you can try to increase the 
LP response time.
<p></p>

# PRINTING, SAVING
    render_block($session,"save","Printing and saving your work",<<PRINTING);
You can print out, save, or reload a previously saved session under the
&quot;session&quot; tab.  The wITIP session ID identifies your session. 
When you return later, the session will be restored to the state you've
left it in.  Next to the session ID at the top of the page an <b>*</b> indicates
that the session content has changed since it was saved (or opened).

<br>

Click on the &quot;change&quot; button to change the session you are
working on; you can return to continue your work any time.

<p></p>
<strong>Printing</strong><br>

Clicking on &quot;print&quot; opens a new page showing all of your macros,
constraints, and recent queries.  You can edit the main title (showing the
session ID and the current date / time), and the section titles as well. 
The buttons hide a whole section, or some part of it, which is useful if
you do not need, for example, the unrolled (internal) form of the
constraints. Entropy expressions are printed using the default 
font (and not the one configured). The unrolled forms use the syntax style
set in the L%configure%configuration%.

<br>

Clicking on the &quot;Print&quot; button prints the visible part of the page
using the browser's printing method.

<p></p>
<strong>Saving and opening</strong><br>

The current state of the session can be saved on your computer by clicking
on the &quot;save&quot; button.  The saved wITIP file can be
&quot;open&quot;ed later, which means that the saved session is restored. 
The wITIP files are bound to both the session and the web server: you cannot
open a saved file using different session ID, or a different wITIP web
server.
<b>Warning:</b>
When opening a saved session, all changes to the current session are lost. 
Please consider saving it first.

# METHOD
    render_block($session,"method","Under the hood: how wITIP works?",<<METHOD);
wITIP transforms the question on the validity of the entered query
into a satisfiability question of an LP problem.

<br>

First, the query is transformed into the following question: is a certain
linear combination of entropies equal to, or &ge; than zero?  When the
question asks for equality, it is further split into whether it is &ge; 0,
and whether its negation is also &ge; 0.  Thus the enquiry is transformed to the
question (or to two questions) of the form

<div class="indent">
  <b>e</b> &ge; 0,
</div>
where <b>e</b> is a linear combination of entropies.

<br>

In the next step all L%var%random variables% occurring in <b>e</b> are
collected; denote this collection by S%V%.  Then the set of all <i>basic
Shannon inequalities</i> is generated.  This set has all inequalities which
state that the entropy increases and is submodular:

<div class="indent">
  S%H(B)-H(A) &ge; 0% <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; where S%A% is a subset of S%B% which is a subset of
                 S%V%; <br>
  S%H(A,C)+H(B,C)-H(C)-H(A,B,C) &ge; 0% <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; where S%A%, S%B% and S%C% are different subsets of S%V%. 
</div>

Then the LP solver is presented with the following solvability problem:

<div class="textindent" style="line-height: normal">
<i>Is there any non-negative linear combination of the basic Shannon
inequalities which gives</i> <b>e</b> &ge; 0 <i>?</i>
</div>
When there are enabled L%constr%constraints%, the basic Shannon
inequalities are supplemented by them: they can contribute
to the combination which finally yields the required inequality.
<p></p>
If the LP solver returns <i>yes</i>, then the result of the query is <span
class="restrue">true</span>; if the LP solver says <i>no</i>, then the
result is <span class="resfalse">false</span>. Consequently, the result
of the query is the answer to the question
<div class="textindent" style="line-height: normal">
<i>Does the query follow from the (basic) Shannon inequalities and
the given constraints?</i>
</div>
and <b>not</b> whether the query is a valid entropy inequality (or
equality) which holds for arbitrary collection of random variables
satisfying the stipulated constraints.

# HISTORY
    render_block($session,"history","History",<<HISTORY);
wITIP is a web-based Information Theoretic Inequality Prover.  The server-side
program was written in E%https://www.perl.org/%Perl% with the exception
of the LP solver engine, which is a C frontend to glpk, the
E%https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/%Gnu Linear Programming Kit%. You can find
the source on E%https://github.com/lcsirmaz/witip%GitHub%.
<p></p>
The E%http://user-www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ITIP%original ITIP software% 
was developed by <i>Raymond W. Yeung</i> and
<i>Ying-On Yan</i>, and runs under MATLAB.
The stand-alone version E%http://xitip.epfl.ch%Xitip% has a graphical interface
and runs both in Windows and Linux.
<br>
This program is a port of E%https://github.com/lcsirmaz/minitip%minitip%, a 
command-line version of ITIP.
